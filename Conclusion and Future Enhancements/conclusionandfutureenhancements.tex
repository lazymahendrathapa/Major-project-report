\section{CONCLUSION}

Among the three deliverables of the project –- Genre based classification system, Mood based classification system and Playlist Generating Application –- substantial
work has been done only on the first job. However, as the feature extraction is close to completion, we expect the latter two jobs to take up less time. So, overall
we can say that we are only slightly behind schedule if not on time. Regardless, we remain on course to meet the project objective.  
\par The current accuracy of the system is very poor indeed but through analysis and further development, it is sure to be improved by the
end of the project. 
\par  We have only briefly discussed the work to be done in the next session. A more detailed methodology and schedule will be created as soon
as possible.
