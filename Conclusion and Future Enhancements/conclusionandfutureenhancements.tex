\section{CONCLUSION}
\subsection{Project Conclusion}
In our musical classification system we have successfully been able to produce satisfactory 
results in all scenarios of genre,arousal and valence based music classification 
As with many projects we faced many problems some of which we were able to solve and some 
which still remain as limitations.\\ 
\\ 
So, overall we can say that we have achieved the satisfactory accuracy in various aspects and 
improving the performance through the continuous integration developmental practice. 
\subsection{Future Enhancements}
A person can never be satisfied with one's work and so is our case. Our project is just a beginning phase which will be ultimately leading to 
huge revolution in future. Hence future enhancements are possible in our project are possible in our project. Mentioning few are:   
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item \textbf{GUI Improvement:}
                As with the current state of the GUI in our system , it is very basic. With every future iteration we 
                hope to improve and introduce newer and attractive elements and animations that pleasantly 
                improve the user experience and encourages user to use our system as much as possible. 
        \item \textbf{Inclusion of additional genres:}
                With only five basic recognizable genres we hope to 
                include further sub genres with these five primary genres such as Pop足Rock, Punk足Rock, 
                Grunge,Indie足Rock for the Rock songs etc 
        \item \textbf{Instrumentals:}
                We also hope to add the ability to add instrumental tracks (i.e tracks 
                without vocals) in future enhancements 
        \item \textbf{Preference changes:}
                Owing to the ever changing nature of music preference of an 
                average user, we may also provide system with ability to change the various genre and 
                mood template so that the system also changes with the change in user preference. 
        \item \textbf{Improve performance:}
                Performance can be improved by using Multi足thread concept. 
        \item \textbf{Business Value:}
        Develop the product as the API so that it can be used in others 
        commercial sites. 
        \end{enumerate}
