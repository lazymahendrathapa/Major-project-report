This progress report details the work completed and remaining work to be done for the final year project titled “Music Classification System
Based on Genre and Mood” as of the end of the mid-term session. The project is part for the curriculum for the subject Major Project under
the course of final year of B.E. in Computer Engineering.
\par The overall aim of the project is to develop a system capable of classifying music based on Genre and mood with the availability of large
number of digital media and the disorder introduced being the primary motivation.  
\par The methodology used is that of a modular system consisting of two main stages. The first stage involves the preprocessing of the raw audio
data resulting in the extraction of a number of features: Intensity, MFCC, rhythm, pitch. Each feature extractor reduces the information content
in the raw data to a vector in a small number of dimensions. 
\par In the second stage, the set of feature vectors are classified(indexed) into certain clusters by the use of certain algorithms: K-means and
Artificial Neural Networks. 
\par The work completed includes feature extraction of Intensity, MFCC and rhythmic features and the implementation of the K-means Clustering Algorithm.
Currently, the accuracy of the system (~46 per cent) is pretty bad but it is sure to be improved further in the coming days.
\par The work to be done includes mood based classification, implementation of the ANN and extraction of the Pitch feature. Apart from those
tasks, we will also be optimizing the parts already completed and also analyzing and validating the individual components and the overall
results.\\
